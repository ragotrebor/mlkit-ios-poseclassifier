# üì± ML Kit Pose Classification on iOS

This project brings pose classification to iOS using [Google's ML Kit Pose Detection](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/pose-detection). It reimplements the [pose classification logic](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/pose-detection/classifying-poses) (including the KNN algorithm) from the official Android sample project, filling the gap left by the lack of an iOS counterpart.

## üéØ Features

- Real-time human pose detection using ML Kit.
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)-based pose classification.
- Custom pose embedding inspired by the Android example.
- Modular and extensible Swift implementation.

## üìç Integration Overview

The `PoseClassifierProcessor` serves as the entry point for the classification module and is referenced inside `CameraViewController.swift`.

When the `Detector.poseClassifier` option is selected in the UI‚Äôs detector picker, the class is instantiated. Its `detectPose(in image: MLImage...)` method processes the results of the pose detection system and forwards them for classification.


## üì• Installation
